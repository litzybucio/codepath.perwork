## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. Instagram
   * Seeing posts and stories of my friends
   * Sharing posts that I find interesting to my firends
   * Being able to post my own stuff

3. TikTok
   * Make and edit fun videos
   * Like and save videos that I like
   * Share videos with my firends 
   

4. StoryGraph
   * I can add my favorite books
   * keep track of the books I am reading and how long it took to read
   * I can see what my friends are currently reading


APP BRAINSTROMING (App Idea)

An app that I would like to create is an app that can allow users to decided what part of the day they would like to be phone free. In that part of the day we can block apps that are their most used so they can be productive in the real world. After successfully completing their goal that can get rewarded on the app. Like a game they can get things for the island/village if they have been phone free. 

## Notes

One thing that I really struggled with in creating this app was where to place the code. Since I had difficulty with the placement of the code the background color would not change when I pressed the button. Later on I was able to figure it out.
